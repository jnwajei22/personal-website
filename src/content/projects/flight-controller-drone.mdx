# Flight Controller Drone

A custom flight controller + drone platform built for **stable autonomous flight**, **sensor fusion**, and higher-level modes (follow/sentry), with a stretch goal of **hand-gesture control**.

## Core capabilities
- **Sensor fusion**: IMU + GPS + barometer + magnetometer (and others as needed)
- **Lidar-assisted navigation**: altitude hold, obstacle awareness, mapping hooks
- **Reliable control stack**: tuned stabilization, failsafes, and logging/telemetry

## Modes (planned)
- **Manual + assisted**: stabilized flight, altitude hold, position hold
- **Autonomous**: waypoint missions and basic navigation behaviors
- **Companion / Follow**: track and follow a target safely
- **Sentry / Patrol**: hold position, monitor area, return-to-home behaviors
- **Stretch**: **hand gesture control** for close-range commands

## Why build it
To own the full stack: hardware design, real-time firmware, estimation/control, and autonomous behavior.
