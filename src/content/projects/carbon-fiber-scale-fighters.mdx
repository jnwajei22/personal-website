# Carbon Fiber Scale Planes

Decorative scale aircraft models built in carbon fiber—less “flight,” more “craft.” The point is staying sharp on CAD and fabrication.

## What it is
- Scale aircraft models designed in **Fusion 360**
- Carbon fiber–focused build approach (structure, panels, finish)
- Display pieces: clean lines, strong materials, good fit/finish

## Why it exists
A consistent way to practice and stay current with 3D modeling (Fusion 360) while building physical objects that look intentional.
