# IoT Dev Board

A flexible prototype board for fast iteration: one platform that supports both **bare-metal/firmware work** and **Linux/SBC-class development** (booting a full OS from storage).

## What it is
- A general-purpose dev board built to prototype ideas quickly
- Supports two workflows:
  - **Bare-metal / firmware**: tight control, real-time behavior, direct hardware access
  - **Linux / SBC-class**: full OS on eMMC/SD, services, networking, rapid app iteration

## Why it exists
So I can prove the software and system behavior first, then spin dedicated hardware once the concept is validated.
