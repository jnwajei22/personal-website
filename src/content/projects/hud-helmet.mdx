# HUD Helmet

A motorsport-inspired HUD helmet built as a joint project with my brother (an aerospace engineer). The goal is a clean, reliable, hands-free interface to your phone—without taking your hands off anything.

## What it is
- Helmet-integrated HUD concept + electronics packaging
- **Sensor fusion** for robust motion-aware control
- **Bluetooth** link to your phone for hands-free interaction

## Planned capabilities
- **IMU motion tracking** for gesture/intent detection
- Hands-free **volume controls**
- Hands-free **voice controls**
- Phone integration: media, calls, and basic assistant-style actions

## Future direction
- Optional deeper integration with **ASTRO AI** for higher-level, local-first control.
