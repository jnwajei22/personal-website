# Capacitive Keyboard Desk

A Tony Stark–style input system evolving from a custom keyboard into a full glass-desk interface: capacitive typing, touch controls, and gesture-driven input.

## V1 — Keyboard + Touch Bar
- Custom mechanical keyboard build
- Integrated “touch bar” strip (quick actions, sliders, macros)
- Firmware + UI for configurable controls

## Full vision — Glass Desk Interface
- Full-size **capacitive keyboard embedded in glass**
- Desk-integrated touch controls and zones
- **Gesture wristband** for cursor/shortcuts and hands-free control
- Designed as a single cohesive workstation UI

## Why build it
To push beyond “keyboard as a peripheral” into an integrated human-interface system: hardware, firmware, and interaction design.
