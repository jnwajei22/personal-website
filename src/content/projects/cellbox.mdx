# CellBOX

A portable “micro cell tower” concept: a **cellular access point** that provides local coverage in remote areas, with **Starlink/satellite backhaul** to the wider internet.

## What it is
- Local cellular coverage (acts like the nearby tower, on a small scale)
- Backhaul via **Starlink / satellite internet** for uplink/downlink
- Rugged, portable, power-aware system design

## Intended use
- Remote work sites, rural coverage gaps, disaster/backup connectivity
- Temporary coverage for small teams and equipment

## Status
- **Proposed / Coming Soon**

## Links
- Repo: (add later)
