# F1 Sim Build

A full DIY sim setup built to feel like a **real cockpit**, not a plastic toy — featuring a custom **F1-style wheel**, pedals, and the **electronics + mechanical integration** needed for reliability and repeatability.

## Core capabilities
- **Intentional wheel UI**: buttons, encoders, screen, and LEDs that feel designed (not slapped on)
- **Clean internal electronics stack**: custom PCB, harnessing, connector choices, and firmware built for reliability
- **Pedal input hardware + tuning**: where it actually improves feel and consistency

## What makes it hard (and fun)
- **Mechanical constraints**: packaging, mounting, tolerances, and service access
- **Power + signal integrity**: stable rails, noise control, and inputs that don’t glitch
- **Input reliability**: debounce, encoder handling, and predictable behavior under real use

## Current focus
- Finalizing the wheel electronics + layout decisions
- Cleaning up wiring/harnessing so it’s serviceable
- Getting inputs stable and predictable under real use

## Next milestones
- Bring-up + validation pass (every input/LED/screen behaves)
- Firmware polish (debounce, encoder handling, profiles)
- Assembly cleanup: strain relief, mounting, and repeatable service access
